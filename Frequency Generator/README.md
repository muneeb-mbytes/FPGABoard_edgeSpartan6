In this project , sound with four different frequencies are generated using Xilinx FPGA Board.
Frequencies are in the range : 261Hz, 277Hz,  493Hz, 523 Hz.
Code is written and dumped on the Xilinx FPGA.
Soon after this, first switch is on, sound with one perticualr frequency is generated on the FPGA board, after that if the reset switch is pressed, no sound will be  generated.
Similarly checked for all the given frequencies are generated as soon as the respective switch is on.
